                        <p>The history of keyboards is a fascinating journey through technology and design, reflecting 
                            the evolution of human-computer interaction. From the earliest mechanical devices to today's 
                            advanced electronic keyboards, the keyboard has played a crucial role in how we communicate 
                            with machines. Letâ€™s explore the key milestones in the history of keyboards.</p>

                        <h2>The Early Beginnings</h2>
                        <p>The concept of a keyboard can be traced back to the 19th century with the invention of the 
                            typewriter. In 1868, Christopher Latham Sholes patented the first practical typewriter, 
                            which featured a QWERTY layout still used today. This layout was designed to prevent jamming 
                            of the typebars in early machines, leading to its widespread adoption.</p>

                        <h2>The Rise of the Computer Keyboard</h2>
                        <p>As computers emerged in the mid-20th century, the keyboard transitioned from a typewriter 
                            model to a specialized input device. The first computer keyboard, developed in the 1960s, 
                            was often a modified typewriter keyboard. In 1981, IBM introduced the Model F keyboard, 
                            which featured the innovative buckling spring mechanism, offering tactile feedback that 
                            became a favorite among users.</p>

                        <h2>Membrane Keyboards and the 1990s</h2>
                        <p>With the rise of personal computers in the 1980s and 1990s, membrane keyboards became 
                            popular due to their lower production costs and thinner designs. These keyboards use a 
                            pressure pad system and are quieter than their mechanical counterparts. However, they often 
                            lacked the tactile feedback that many users preferred.</p>

                        <h2>The Mechanical Keyboard Renaissance</h2>
                        <p>In the early 2000s, mechanical keyboards saw a resurgence in popularity, particularly among 
                            gamers and typing enthusiasts. Manufacturers began producing keyboards with various switch 
                            types, such as Cherry MX, allowing users to choose the feel and sound of their keyboard. 
                            This period also saw the rise of customizable keyboards, leading to a new era of personal 
                            expression in keyboard design.</p>

                        <p>Today, keyboards come in various forms, including ergonomic designs, wireless options, and 
                            RGB lighting. The integration of technology has also led to the development of smart 
                            keyboards with programmable keys and touch-sensitive controls. Mechanical keyboards remain 
                            a favorite among enthusiasts, while membrane keyboards continue to serve as budget-friendly 
                            options for everyday users.</p>
