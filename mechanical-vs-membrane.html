                        <h2>Mechanical Keyboards</h2>
                        <p>Mechanical keyboards are known for their distinct tactile feedback and durability. They use 
                            individual mechanical switches for each key, which can provide a satisfying click and response 
                            that many typists and gamers prefer. Here are some key features:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Tactile Feedback:</strong> Mechanical keyboards offer a noticeable bump when the key 
                                is pressed, allowing for more accurate typing.</li>
                            <li><strong>Variety of Switches:</strong> Users can choose from various switch types, including 
                                Cherry MX, Razer, and others, each offering different sounds and feels.</li>
                            <li><strong>Longevity:</strong> Mechanical switches typically last longer than membrane switches, 
                                often rated for tens of millions of key presses.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Membrane Keyboards</h2>
                        <p>Membrane keyboards utilize a different technology, relying on a rubber dome that collapses when 
                            pressed. They are generally quieter and more affordable. Here are some of their features:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Soft Feel:</strong> Membrane keyboards often feel softer and quieter than mechanical 
                                keyboards.</li>
                            <li><strong>Compact Design:</strong> Many membrane keyboards are slim and lightweight, making 
                                them easier to transport.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> They are typically more budget-friendly compared to 
                                mechanical keyboards.</li>

                        <p>Choosing between mechanical and membrane keyboards ultimately depends on your personal 
                            preferences and how you intend to use them. Mechanical keyboards are often favored by gamers 
                            and typists who seek a premium experience, while membrane keyboards are ideal for those 
                            seeking affordability and a quieter typing experience. Consider your needs and try out 
                            both types if possible to find the best fit for you!</p>
